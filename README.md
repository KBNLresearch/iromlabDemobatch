# Iromlab demo batch

This repo illustrates the structure of a batch created by the [*iromlab*](https://github.com/KBNLresearch/iromlab) software. The demo batch contains  output for 4 carriers. Note that the actual ISO / FLAC files (which are copyrighted) are repaced by empty (zero-byte) files in this repo. This also means that the checksums in the *.sha512* do not match the files.
